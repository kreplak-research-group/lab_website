Our lab works at the interface of Biological and Soft Matter Physics. We are interested in fibrous systems both
_in vivo_ and _in vitro_. One long-term goal is to understand how collagen incurs damage in tendons and to produce a bottom-up collagen fibre for tendon repair. Another long-term goal is to make high-performance protein fibres using waste proteins.

- Collagen assembly and function in Tendons:
  
- Protein and polymer microfibres fabrication by extensional flow:
